React Priority+ Nav Menu
==========================

This is (yet another) [React](https://reactjs.org/) implemention of the Priority+ navigation menu pattern [1]. The logic for this implementation was heavily adapted from [this CodePen by Matt Walker](https://codepen.io/zammer/pen/pbxJdo). The built-in hamburger menu toggle implementation is an adaptation of [this CodePen by Elijah Manor](https://codepen.io/elijahmanor/pen/Igpoe).

## Development
- Clone the repository and run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
- Run `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev` to start up the instance of [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/), and then open your browser to [http://localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060).
- Edit as necessary/desired, and let hot module reloading take care of the rest for you.
